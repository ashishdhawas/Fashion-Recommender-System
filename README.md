## Fashion Recommender System

Project Overview:


Developed a Streamlit Application which is a Fashion Recommender System. Users can upload an image of a fashion item, and the application extracts features using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. It then recommends similar fashion items based on the extracted features. The user interface includes a file upload option, the display of the uploaded image, and a set of recommended items with their respective images. The application provides error handling during file upload and could benefit from additional styling and user instructions for an enhanced experience. Overall, it's a functional and user-friendly fashion recommendation tool.
